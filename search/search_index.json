Apple Analysis of the apple fruit is carried out by using the fruit itself. The focus of the analysis is on assessing the damage on the fruit and identifying the treatment type that has the most impact in reducing damage under various environmental conditions. The analysis could help to identify the rate at which a specific sample starts to rot based on the condition it is exposed to. Steps for Manual analysis Once the application has started, the user must set the SOURCE TYPE as MANUAL . Next the crop type option must be set to APPLE . The analysis option must be set to ANALYZE RED AREA . The image containing the treatments must be analyzed by selecting the same from a local folder. Based on the arrangement of the fruit samples in the image, the user must set the number of rows and columns in the image in the ROWS and COLUMNS field. The SPECIMEN COUNT field must be set to a value that reflects the number of specimens in the supplied image that must be analyzed. The user must next select an RGB/PDF file that contains values to train the model. If the user requires detailed images of every step of the analysis, the user must set the GET DETAILED RESULTS option to YES , otherwise it must be set to NO . Once all the options have been set and reviewed, the user must click the PROCESS button once. Once the process has started, the progress can be tracked using the progress bar. Once completed, the DOWNLOAD button will be enabled. Clicking the button will initiate the download of a zip file from the default browser in the user's system. Once the zip file has been downloaded, the user can extract the files and analyze the images and data therein. If another analysis needs to be run, the button REFRESH can be clicked, which will clear all existing values on-screen and will allow the user to run another analysis. Banana Crop Analysis Instruction Cowpea Cowpea analysis is carried out by using the Cowpea plant leaves. The focus of the analysis is on assessing the phyto damage on the leaves and identifying the treatment type that has the most impact in reducing phyto damage under various environmental conditions. Steps for Manual analysis Once the application has started, the user must set the SOURCE TYPE as MANUAL . Next the crop type option must be set to COWPEA . The analysis option must be set to ANALYZE PHYTO DAMAGE . The image containing the treatments must be analyzed by selecting the same from a local folder. Based on the arrangement of the leaves in the image, the user must set the number of rows and columns in the image in the ROWS and COLUMNS field. The SPECIMEN COUNT field must be a set to a value that reflects the number of specimens in the supplied image must be analyzed. The user must next select an RGB/PDF file that contains values to train the model. If the user requires detailed images of every step of the analysis, the user must set the GET DETAILED RESULTS option to YES , otherwise it must be set to NO . Once all the options have been set and reviewed, the user must click the PROCESS button once. The indicator that the button has been pressed will be indicate by the color of the button changing to green. Once the process has started, the progress can be tracked using the progress bar. Once completed, the DOWNLOAD button will be enabled. Clicking the button will initiate the download of a zip file from the default browser. Once the zip file has been downloaded, the user can extract the files and analyze the image and data therein. If another analysis needs to be run, the button REFRESH can be clicked, which will clear all existing values on-screen and will allow the user to run another analysis.
