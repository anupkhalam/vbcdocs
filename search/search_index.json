The generation of the same requires text files that will be in a specific format. These text files will contain the information required for processing the crop related images. MANUAL QR Format The text file used to generate QR codes for manual processing must be in the following format. info_<Name of attribute>:<Value of attribute>|info_<Name of next attribute>:<Value of next attribute> This QR is meant to hold additional information besides what is defined by the user. Each additional information attribute must be preceded by the string info_ . Multiple additional information attributes can be added. Each attribute must be separated by a pipe ( | ) symbol. e.g with data. info_Study Name:ACC Salts Cowpea 031721|info_Photo Id:cowpea_image_1 AUTO QR Format Unlike the QR used for manual processing, the QR for automatic processing is more elaborate as it holds all the necessary information required to process an image without user intervention. Generation of this QR has 3 pre-requisites: An information text file with data in a specific format containing the parameters and additional information required for processing. The location of the above mentioned text file in the remote system in which it is stored. The location of the PDF/RGB file that maintains RGB data of the crop image. Information text file format The file format of the information text file must be as follows: app_crop:<Name of crop being processed> | app_analysis:<Type of analysis being run on the crop image> | app_rows:<Number of rows in the image, the crop is spread out to> | app_cols:<Number of columns in the image, the crop is spread out to> | app_interim_results:<Options YES or NO to highlight whether the detailed images must be generated>|app_specimen_count:<Number of specifimens of the crop in the image being processed>|info_<Name of attribute>:<Value of attribute>|info_<Name of next attribute>:<Value of next attribute> The file contains two sets of data: Parameters - These parameters are what are entered by the user using the User Interface when running the image processing manually. These parameters are fixed and identifiable by the prefix app_ . A value is mandatory for each parameter to ensure that processing runs smoothly. The parameters are as follows: app_crop : Name of crop being processed. app_analysis : Type of analysis being run on the crop image. app_rows : Number of rows in the image, the crop is spread out to. app_cols : Number of columns in the image, the crop is spread out to. app_interim_results : Indicator that signals whether detailed images must be generated at each stage of the process. The parameter accepts only one of two values namely YES or NO. app_specimen_count : Number of specimens of the crop in the image being processed. Additional information - This is additional information that needs to be associated to image processing of the crop. These additional attributes are identifiable by the prefix info_ . These attributes must have a name and a value associated to it. The additional information attributes must follow the parameters. All the parameters and attributes must be separated by the pipe ( | ) symbol. e.g with data. app_crop:COWPEA|app_analysis:ANALYZE_PHYTO_DAMAGE|app_rows:3|app_cols:2|app_interim_results:YES| app_specimen_count:5|info_Study Name:ACC Salts Cowpea 031721|info_Photo Id:cowpea_image_1 QR Generation text file format Once the pre-requisites are available, the text file to generate a QR must be created using the following format: rgb:<Location of the PDF/RGB file in the remote server>|details:<Location of the Information text file> The file contains two parameters: rgb : This is the link to the location in the remote server where the PDF/RGB file related to the crop being analyzed is maintained. details : This is the link to the location in the remote server where the information text file is maintained.

Apple Analysis of the apple fruit is carried out by using the fruit itself. The focus of the analysis is on assessing the damage on the fruit and identifying the treatment type that has the most impact in reducing damage under various environmental conditions. The analysis could help to identify the rate at which a specific sample starts to rot based on the condition it is exposed to. Steps for Manual analysis Once the application has started, the user must set the SOURCE TYPE as MANUAL . Next the crop type option must be set to APPLE . The analysis option must be set to ANALYZE RED AREA . The image containing the treatments must be analyzed by selecting the same from a local folder. Based on the arrangement of the fruit samples in the image, the user must set the number of rows and columns in the image in the ROWS and COLUMNS field. The SPECIMEN COUNT field must be set to a value that reflects the number of specimens in the supplied image that must be analyzed. The user must next select an RGB/PDF file that contains values to train the model. If the user requires detailed images of every step of the analysis, the user must set the GET DETAILED RESULTS option to YES , otherwise it must be set to NO . Once all the options have been set and reviewed, the user must click the PROCESS button once. Once the process has started, the progress can be tracked using the progress bar. Once completed, the DOWNLOAD button will be enabled. Clicking the button will initiate the download of a zip file from the default browser in the user's system. Once the zip file has been downloaded, the user can extract the files and analyze the images and data therein. If another analysis needs to be run, the button REFRESH can be clicked, which will clear all existing values on-screen and will allow the user to run another analysis. Banana Crop Analysis Instruction Cowpea Cowpea analysis is carried out by using the Cowpea plant leaves. The focus of the analysis is on assessing the phyto damage on the leaves and identifying the treatment type that has the most impact in reducing phyto damage under various environmental conditions. Steps for Manual analysis Once the application has started, the user must set the SOURCE TYPE as MANUAL . Next the crop type option must be set to COWPEA . The analysis option must be set to ANALYZE PHYTO DAMAGE . The image containing the treatments must be analyzed by selecting the same from a local folder.
